    "**RAG or Retrieval Augmented Generation** - is a technique that is widely used in industry to help reduce model hallucination.\n",
    "For example, have you ever tryed to ask ChatGPT as questions about something that you know about and the answer is just made up?\n",
    "This is what we call a **hallucination** and RAG is a technique that we use to reduce hallucination. \n",
    "\n",
    "RAG does this by finding relavant chuncks of text to add to your prompt before sending it off to a LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this useful?** \n",
    "Models like ChatGPT are training on the internet. What if you ask it a questions, which it wasn't training on? Can you think of such questions? \n",
    "For example, let's say you have a business with your own data. You don't share any of that data on the internet or to anyone outside your business. \n",
    "How can you create a chatbot that let's you have a converation with your business data? You use RAG!\n",

In this paper, we\\nexplore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-speciﬁc actions\\nin an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning\\ntraces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle\\nexceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information\\nfrom external sources such as knowledge bases or environments. We apply our\\napproach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks\\nand demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to\\nimproved human interpretability and trustworthiness. Concretely, on question\\nanswering (HotpotQA) and fact veriﬁcation (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent\\nissues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by\\ninteracting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving\\ntrajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.\\nFurthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and\\nWebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by\\nan absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with\\nonly one or two in-context examples.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nA unique feature of human intelligence is the ability to seamlessly combine task-oriented actions with\\nverbal reasoning (or inner speech, Alderson-Day & Fernyhough, 2015), which has been theorized to\\nplay an important role in human cognition for enabling self-regulation or strategization (Vygotsky,\\n1987; Luria, 1965; Fernyhough, 2010) and maintaining a working memory (Baddeley, 1992). Con-\\nsider the example of cooking up a dish in the kitchen. Between any two speciﬁc actions, we may\\nreason in language in order to track progress (“now that everything is cut, I should heat up the pot of\\nwater”), to handle exceptions or adjust the plan according to the situation (“I don’t have salt, so let\\nme use soy sauce and pepper instead”), and to realize when external information is needed (“how do\\nI prepare dough? Let me search on the Internet”). We may also act (open a cookbook to read the\\nrecipe, open the fridge, check ingredients) to support the reasoning and to answer questions (“What\\ndish can I make right now?”). This tight synergy between “acting” and “reasoning” allows humans\\nto learn new tasks quickly and perform robust decision making or reasoning, even under previously\\nunseen circumstances or facing information uncertainties.\\nRecent results have hinted at the possibility of combining verbal reasoning with interactive decision\\nmaking in autonomous systems. On one hand, properly prompted large language models (LLMs)\\nhave demonstrated emergent capabilities to carry out several steps of reasoning traces to derive\\n∗Work during Google internship.

In this paper, we\\nexplore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-speciﬁc actions\\nin an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning\\ntraces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle\\nexceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information\\nfrom external sources such as knowledge bases or environments. We apply our\\napproach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks\\nand demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to\\nimproved human interpretability and trustworthiness. Concretely, on question\\nanswering (HotpotQA) and fact veriﬁcation (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent\\nissues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by\\ninteracting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving\\ntrajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.\\nFurthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and\\nWebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by\\nan absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with\\nonly one or two in-context examples.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nA unique feature of human intelligence is the ability to seamlessly combine task-oriented actions with\\nverbal reasoning (or inner speech, Alderson-Day & Fernyhough, 2015), which has been theorized to\\nplay an important role in human cognition for enabling self-regulation or strategization (Vygotsky,\\n1987; Luria, 1965; Fernyhough, 2010) and maintaining a working memory (Baddeley, 1992). Con-\\nsider the example of cooking up a dish in the kitchen. Between any two speciﬁc actions, we may\\nreason in language in order to track progress (“now that everything is cut, I should heat up the pot of\\nwater”), to handle exceptions or adjust the plan according to the situation (“I don’t have salt, so let\\nme use soy sauce and pepper instead”), and to realize when external information is needed (“how do\\nI prepare dough? Let me search on the Internet”). We may also act (open a cookbook to read the\\nrecipe, open the fridge, check ingredients) to support the reasoning and to answer questions (“What\\ndish can I make right now?”). This tight synergy between “acting” and “reasoning” allows humans\\nto learn new tasks quickly and perform robust decision making or reasoning, even under previously\\nunseen circumstances or facing information uncertainties.\\nRecent results have hinted at the possibility of combining verbal reasoning with interactive decision\\nmaking in autonomous systems. On one hand, properly prompted large language models (LLMs)\\nhave demonstrated emergent capabilities to carry out several steps of reasoning traces to derive\\n∗Work during Google internship.

IX. C ONCLUSION\\nDeep learning offers a way to harness large amount of computation and data with little engineering by hand [90]. With\\ndistributed representation, various deep models have become the new state-of-the-art methods for NLP problems. Supervised\\nlearning is the most popular practice in recent deep learning research for NLP. In many real-world scenarios, however, we have\\nunlabeled data which require advanced unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches. In cases where there is lack of labeled data\\nfor some particular classes or the appearance of a new class while testing the model, strategies like zero-shot learning should\\nbe employed. These learning schemes are still in their developing phase but we expect deep learning based NLP research to be\\ndriven in the direction of making better use of unlabeled data. We expect such trend to continue with more and better model\\ndesigns. We expect to see more NLP applications that employ reinforcement learning methods, e.g., dialogue systems. We also\\nexpect to see more research on multimodal learning [190] as, in the real world, language is often grounded on (or correlated\\nwith) other signals. Finally, we expect to see more deep learning models whose internal memory (bottom-up knowledge learned from the data)\\nis enriched with an external memory (top-down knowledge inherited from a KB). Coupling symbolic and sub-symbolic AI\\nwill be key for stepping forward in the path from NLP to natural language understanding. Relying on machine learning, in\\nfact, is good to make a ‘good guess’ based on past experience, because sub-symbolic methods encode correlation and their\\ndecision-making process is probabilistic. Natural language understanding, however, requires much more than that.

IX. C ONCLUSION\\nDeep learning offers a way to harness large amount of computation and data with little engineering by hand [90]. With\\ndistributed representation, various deep models have become the new state-of-the-art methods for NLP problems. Supervised\\nlearning is the most popular practice in recent deep learning research for NLP. In many real-world scenarios, however, we have\\nunlabeled data which require advanced unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches. In cases where there is lack of labeled data\\nfor some particular classes or the appearance of a new class while testing the model, strategies like zero-shot learning should\\nbe employed. These learning schemes are still in their developing phase but we expect deep learning based NLP research to be\\ndriven in the direction of making better use of unlabeled data. We expect such trend to continue with more and better model\\ndesigns. We expect to see more NLP applications that employ reinforcement learning methods, e.g., dialogue systems. We also\\nexpect to see more research on multimodal learning [190] as, in the real world, language is often grounded on (or correlated\\nwith) other signals. Finally, we expect to see more deep learning models whose internal memory (bottom-up knowledge learned from the data)\\nis enriched with an external memory (top-down knowledge inherited from a KB). Coupling symbolic and sub-symbolic AI\\nwill be key for stepping forward in the path from NLP to natural language understanding. Relying on machine learning, in\\nfact, is good to make a ‘good guess’ based on past experience, because sub-symbolic methods encode correlation and their\\ndecision-making process is probabilistic. Natural language understanding, however, requires much more than that. To use Noam\\nChomsky’s words, “you do not get discoveries in the sciences by taking huge amounts of data, throwing them into a computer\\nand doing statistical analysis of them: that’s not the way you understand things, you have to have theoretical insights”.
